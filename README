AppengineJS Example
===================

A simple Blog, powered by [AppengineJS](http:/www.appenginejs.org) and [Nitro](http://www.nitrojs.org). 

This application is intended as an example to help developers get started with AppengineJS. It is not intended for deployment as a public application. A real world application should utilize an http caching strategy, static files optimization, etc. We tried to make things self explanatory and readable instead of optimal.

The blog demonstrates the Datastore API, the Blobstore API and the Users API. A future version may demonstrate additional APIs.

* Issue tracking: [http://github.com/gmosx/appengine/issues](http://github.com/gmosx/appengine/issues)


Setup
-----

This is a special prepackaged version of the application that includes all required packages:

* appengine
* nitro 
* normal-template

However, you have to download the [Google App Engine Java SDK](http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html). Make sure that the SDK bin directory is in path.


Running the example
-------------------

To start the application, just use:

    $ cd appengine-blog-example
    $ dev_appserver.sh . 

Please note that the example is configured for debuging: it reloads the app per request, compilation is dissabled, debuging middleware is inserted in the request pipeline. You should use a production configuration for deployment.

NEW: A small demonstration of the blobstore API is added to the example. Just visit localhost:8080/blobstore to check this out.


Deploying to Google App Engine
------------------------------

To deploy this application to Google App Engine (GAE) use the appcfg.sh utility that comes with the SDK:

    $ cd appengine-blog-example
    $ appcfg.sh update . 

WARNING: Don't forget to switch to a production configuration for deployment. Here is an example:

    handlers:
      - url: /*
        servlet: org.ringojs.jsgi.JsgiServlet
        name: ringo
        init_params:  
            module-path: src
            config: main
            app: app 
            production: true
            optlevel: 9
            ringo-home: /


Directory structure
-------------------

* /root - the public directory, static files etc come here.
* /src - the source code of the application.
* /src/root - action script files.
* /src/templates - template files.
* /packages - commonjs packages.
* /WEB-INF - servlet stuff, generated automatically (ignore this dir)
* /WEB-INF/lib - java .jar files. (typically you ignore this)
